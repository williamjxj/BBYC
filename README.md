
This BBYC - MVC ASSESMENT is implemented by Backbone.js.

(1) Backbone JavaScript MVC:
From the file structure, it is clear to identify the MVC design and implementation:

In js/ directory:
- collections/
- models/
- routers/
- views/
- app.js


(2) Live Demo:
There is a live demo for this assignment: which is accessible at:

- http://www.dixitruth.com/Bestbuy/BBYC/index.html


(3) About the source codes:
All the source codes are reside in js/ directory and $HOME/index.html.

- Use 'Backbone.js' as the assignment's MVC implementation.

- Use 'Underscore.js' as JavaScript object processing support.

- Use 'Underscore.js' templates for the templates support.

- Use 'jQuery' for DOM processing support.

- Use 'Twitter Bootstrap' as CSS framework, and the 'Modal' processing.

For convenient checking and decreasing the assignment-file size, I use CDN to access the general public resources such as Backbone, jQuery from 'cdnjs' website.

I also include the 'bower.json' file which can quickly localize these public js files by just using 'bower install' package command.


(4) For the Unit tests and functional tests:

- I use QUnit framework for a simple Unit test (Backbone Model), which is available at:
http://www.dixitruth.com/Bestbuy/BBYC/qunit_test.html

- I use Jasmine BDD framework to demonstrate the Behavior tests, which is available at:
http://www.dixitruth.com/Bestbuy/BBYC/jasmine_test.html


(5) Extra resource include:

Besides the main Backbone version of assignment, I also did a small 'jQuery version' implementation to show my professional skills. Which is available at:

- http://www.dixitruth.com/Bestbuy/BBYC_jQuery/index.html

The both share the Underscore-style 'templates' so the screen looks very similar. For more information, please see the 'BBYC_jQuery' package which is attached with this main package.

(6) Cross-browser testing:
I tested in Chrome, IE 11, and Firefox, and Tablets, the assignment demos run well.
